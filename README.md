CSCI-104 HW3

Heap written questions:
- These were in the file titled "2022-10-11 21-40.pdf" in the initial on-time git commit
- I've added a properly named copy of that pdf called "q4_heaps.pdf" but it has identical contents to the original pdf

Notes on how to run logic sim

To run the logic simulator:
1. Navigate to the logicsim folder
2. Type make
3. Type "./logicsim <name of txt file>"
3. Type "./logicsim <name of txt file from step 3> > <name of uml file>"
4. Type "java -jar plantuml.jar <name of uml file from steps 3 and 4>"
5. A png file with the same name as uml should have been created

Please note while regrading: In the original grading for this project, I got 0 points on this part. 
My code for the actual simulator has not changed at all, and the above steps work fine
in my codio terminal for producing the appropriate png's. I have tried adding the plantuml.jar file 
to this git repo to hopefully fix this issue because the feedback only said "did not generate the 
grade.png file. Unable to access jarfile plantuml.jar"
- If the same issue persists, please try the above steps on running logicsim manually, because I
  do not know any other fixes to this issue, yet the actual code I wrote generates the logic gate png's fine
  when following the instructions on the Codio tab.
